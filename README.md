# CSE2102Lab1
In this lab we learn how to use maven to test the code we ran in lab 0
## How to Run Code:
- ensure you are running the latest version of maven (https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- clone this directory into your local directory
- In terminal, ensuring that you navigated to the "my-app"
1. run "mvn package"
2. run "mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mycompany.app.TestMe"
3. run "mvn test" to ensure tests display "Build Success"
